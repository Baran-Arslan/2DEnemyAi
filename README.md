# 2DEnemyAi
These are 2D enemy AI codes written for Unity. It includes different features for different types of enemies such as teleport, flying, and shooting from afar. The code needs a little reorganization, there is some redundant code at some points, but because I was doing this project for a client and the deadline was coming, I delivered them without editing.
